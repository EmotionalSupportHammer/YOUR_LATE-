**Main menu:** 

As a player I want the main menu to be readable and clear to multiple audiences. Using the Verdana font (it makes it easier for people with dyslexia to read.) 

As a player I want the buttons to be easily readable with simplistic menus.

**Game play:**

**Power Ups:**

As a casual player I want to be able to **pick up power ups** from enemies.

Acceptance criteria: The player can bounce off or run into an enemy to steal their item as a temp power up. To help the player get through the game.

As a casual player I want to be able to upgrade my charter between runs. This is to help reword the player for doing runs and encourage them to continue to play the game.

As a player I want to be able to trigger an ability that is based on a charge. This is to give the player a level of control during their runs, and the charge is to prevent them from overusing it.
