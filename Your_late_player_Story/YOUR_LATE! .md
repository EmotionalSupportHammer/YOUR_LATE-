**Game title: YOUR LATE**

**Backstory:**

Essentially the idea you are a little robot named B.O.T (Be On Time) that has been created by a scientist named Doctor Doctor with 1 job. Make sure that they don't miss their flight by any means necessary. However you have just one problem: both of you overslept and you only have 10 minutes before the flight leaves you behind.

**Scrolling / Perspective:** Vertical scrolling

**Genre:** Rogue like with endless runner elements.

**Movement & Abilities:** The player is always propelled to the right side of the screen, However the little wheels you had broken off, hitting the ground means that you lose speed if you stop the run ends. The player has a short range grappling hook with a 270 degree turning radius that they can use to try and grab on to airborne targets however this tool has a recharge of about 1.5 seconds.

Power ups that the player can grab while moving that give them an increase to their speed and sometimes have an extra effect.

**Action / Conflict:** There will be some traps that the player should avoid but the biggest problem you are going to run how are you going to keep your speed up you will naturally slow down slowly but hitting the ground 

**Characters: Protagonist:**The player B.O.T the scientist Doctor Doctor. **Antagonist:** Physical obstacles and the cops (your going like 100mph in a 30mph)

**Player Motivations**: Create an addictive game loop of doing a run getting upgrades and repeat simple but addictive.

**Target Market / Audience:** Most likely ages 8 \- 16 most likely being students who are not paying attention in class.

**Structure / Progression:** There are a set of walls that you need to be able to break through by building enough speed before you hit them

**Inspirations & Competition:**  
The game itself is heavily inspired by the flash game Burrito Bison (yes this is a real game)  
With its main competition being, games like Burrito Bison or endless runners. 

**End goal:** My end goal is to make a fun but simple game to help people kill time that they can pick up and drop at any time. By having a loop of do run get upgrade get further repeat.
